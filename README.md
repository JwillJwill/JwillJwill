- 👋 Hi, I’m @JwillJwill
- 👀 I’m interested in learning in general, I'm fascinated with tech due to this aspect, I enjoy gaining knowledge and applying it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to complete a fully functioning e-commerce site for purchasing training products.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will assist in sharpening my skills in Python. (Gaming and/or Social Media to be specific. I'm also gaining traction in Cyber Security, developing a strong interest in understanding the concepts of sockets, ports, servers, etc., also deep diving into the concepts of Threading, Cores, and concurrent algorithms. As these are vital aspects of the gaming modules and programs for seamless interactions.)
